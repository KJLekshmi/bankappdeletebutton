ANGULAR SERVICES
................
Angular services are objects that get instantiated just once during the lifetime of an application. 
They contain methods that maintain data throughout the life of an application,
 i.e., data is available all the time.
 *When we create a service only 2 files are created 1.tsfile 2.specification file
 
 *src>app>create a folder-> then open cmd-> ng g s service_name
